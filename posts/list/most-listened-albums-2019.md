Here are the top 10 albums that I listened to, the most, in 2019:

        <div class="artist">Rage Against The Machine</div>
    </div>
</a>

Rage Against The Machine is the self-titled debut album by American rap metal band Rage Against The Machine. I like RATM's music a lot, especially their debut album. I don't think any other band has quite been able to create such an amazing mixture of rap and metal. Zack's ferocious lyrics and an even more aggressive delivery on top of Tom and Tim's strings, combined with some amazing drums from Brad, make this album a must-listen for people who enjoy heavy, politically-charged music.

        <div class="title">The Cold Vein</div>
        <div class="artist">Cannibal Ox</div>
    </div>
</a>

The Cold Vein was the first studio album from New York-based rap duo Cannibal Ox, consisting of Vast Aire and Vordul Mega. The album was released on El-P's Def Jux record label. The whole album was by produced by El-P himself. It's considered to be one of the greatest records to come out of the independent hip-hop scene. The album creates a vivid depiction of a poverty-stricken New York. Not many rappers will be able to match the pure technical skill exhibited by Vast and Vordul. One of the things that makes this album so great is, of course, El-P's amazing production here.

    </div>
</a>

"The Glow, Pt. 2" is the third studio album and the magnum opus of indie-folk band, The Microphones, fronted by Phil Elverum. It is a concept album detailing Phil's feelings and thoughts during and after a tough breakup with his girlfriend. The album is an amazing mixture of indie folk, lo-fi and noise rock. It is very immersive and at moments, very breathtaking. This is definitely something you should check out if you enjoy indie music. Phil's vocals sound amazing with pleasant and lively tunes laid beneath.

</a>

Atrocity Exhibition is the fourth studio album by rapper Danny Brown. Most of the album is produced by produced by Paul White. I absolutely love this album. There isn't much that I dislike about this album. To find something that I dislike, I'd really have to nitpick a lot of things. I slept on this album before, because I couldn't really get myself to listen to Danny (because of his voice) On the album, Danny brings out all his pain and suffering and brings you through it. The production is absolutely amazing on this thing, some of the best beats I've heard. However, it's not really a traditional hip-hop album, at least, not in terms of the music. With amazing beats by Paul and incredible flows by Danny, you'd be hard-pressed to find any other hip-hop album that sounds something so unique.

</a>

To Pimp a Butterfly is Kendrick Lamar’s second major label studio album, and third full length project. I, personally think this is THE best hip-hop album of all time. I know it has a reputation of being "over-rated", but it really is one of the best hip-hop compositions. Kendrick's deep, intricate lyrics combined with some amazing production from producers like Thundercat and Flying Lotus, are some of the highlights of this record. The album takes a lot of influence from genres like jazz and funk, but is still rooted in hip-hop. This album’s concept explores themes of self-love and hate, fame, depression, violence, race, and politics through a spoken-word poem that interweaves between songs, leading up to the climax. The album contains a lot of nuances that you'll be find the more you listen to the album. This is a must-listen for anyone who considers themselves a true hip-hop fan.

</a>

RTJ2 is the second-album from Run The Jewels, a hip-hop super-duo, as I like to call them. Mike and El-P joined forces again after the release of their first RTJ album which was amazing. But, RTJ2 takes that to another level with a much more dark and layered production. The lyrics on this record are very raw and gritty as well. The record starts with Mike saying that he will bang this bitch the fuck out. That sets the tone of how raw and crude this record is about to be with its lyrics. It's not all just trash talk, however. Both Mike and El-P describe how they vulnerable in this world in many of the songs. Songs like Early and Angel Duster, are very introspective and to a degree, a little depressing as well. RTJ2 is an almost-perfect mix of trash talk, introspection and semi-political messaging.

RTJ3 is the third iteration in the Run The Jewels discography, serving as a follow-up to the critically-acclaimed RTJ2. It features guest appearances from the likes of Danny Brown, Zack de la Rocha, Trina and Kamasi Washington. de la Rocha and BOOTS join RTJ again after they collaborated on their previous record, RTJ2. The album bangs relentlessly and is very fun to listen to. It's even more political than their previous record. El-P still manages to provide us with amazing Sci-Fi inspired production on this record. Mike and El don't slack in the lyrics department, either. Overall, a very enjoyable record which holds strong political opinions and makes sure that you hear them, with amazing production and raw, visceral observational lyrics from both Mike and Jaime.

All My Heroes Are Cornballs, is Peggy’s third studio album, following up his critically-acclaimed 2018 sophomore album, Veteran. After the release of the aforementioned Veteran, Peggy recorded around 93 songs for the next project which he whittled to about 18 songs, adding up to the runtime of 45 minutes. There's a lot more singing on this record than his previous record, which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing. But, the quality of singing is really lacking on some of the songs which end up sounding really annoying. Most of the record contains Peggy's signature glitch-hop beats which are very fun to listen to. However, due to their glitchy nature, this record might not really be a listen for hip-hop traditionalists. I, for one, enjoy this album a lot.

Veteran is an avant-garde, experimental glitch-hop album from rapper JPEGMAFIA, who is also know by his fans as Peggy. It is his sophomore album, containing features by his friends from Baltimore - Bobbi Rush, Yung Midpack and Freaky. The album’s title refers to Peggy’s legal status as a veteran. This album is what I think could be considered as Peggy's signature sound. The album revolves around themes and topics such as self-reflection, politics, pop culture, gentrification, race, guns & violence. It is an amazing listening experience throughout. A lot of the songs from the album are prominent in my daily rotation.

</a>

Upon its release, Death Grips' debut studio album became their magnum opus. The Money Store instantly marked an evolutionary step forward in experimental, industrial, and underground hip-hop. Death Grips created one of the most innovative musical releases of the decade through utilization of the trio’s individual and collective strengths; MC Ride’s raw, visceral, and abrasive vocals, Andy ‘Flatlander’ Morin’s distorted, mechanical sonics, and Zach Hill’s explosive drumming style, coupled with his adept creative direction. The lyrics create a bleak, dystopian atmosphere, with Ride’s cryptic wordplay and intense delivery setting the scene for a dark future. Despite these factors, the album manages to be supremely catchy, with its combination of infectious, earworm hooks and upbeat, experimental production.
