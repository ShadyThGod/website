description: My 10 favourite albums from the year 2019
---

2019 saw the release of many a music projects, many of which I gave a listen to. Of all the releases I was able to give a listen to, there were some that I liked, some that I didn't. Here are 10 of those projects from the year which I enjoyed a lot.

Do note that the ordering of the list is not rock-solid. What record I'm enjoying more than the others, changes often depending on my mood. Also, you might notice that most of the albums here are hip-hop albums, and that's because hip-hop is the genre that I mostly listen to. That, by the way, does not mean I don't listen to any other genre. I try and listen to music of any genre I'm presented with. If I like it, then I like it, and if I don't, I don't.

I've created this list based on what new projects from 2019 I enjoyed the most. This is just my opinion. I haven't ordered the list by any quantifiable measures; it's just based on enjoyment. That's because I don't think it's fair to rate music objectively. Everybody's taste in music differs, and not everybody will agree with each other's picks. Anyways, I hope you find something here that you might like.

        <div class="title">Malibu Ken</div>
        <div class="artist">Aesop Rock, TOBACCO</div>
    </div>
</a>

The honorable mention goes to the new Aesop Rock album that he has created in collaboration with producer TOBACCO - "Malibu Ken". The self-titled album is a short affair with 10 songs combining for a runtime of just 31 minutes. Aesop Rock, at this point an underground legend, is one of the most consistent and talented rappers you'll ever find. His style might not be suitable to everybody's taste, but that doesn't deter the fact that how Aes manages to have raps jam-packed with slick rhyme schemes that even though might be hard to decipher, paint vivid creations. This is album is very good combination of Aesop's lyrical talent and TOBACCO's production skills. Having the lyrics of the songs open while listening to this might prove very helpful and might enhance the enjoyment you get out of this. Overall, it's a pretty good record!

        <div class="artist">Danny Brown</div>
    </div>
</a>

Next up is the latest record from acclaimed Detroit rapper Danny Brown. uknowhatimsayin is a much more lenient record than Danny's previous works. The contents of this album aren't as extreme and dark as his previous record, Atrocity Exhibition. The run-time of the album is just 34 minutes running throughout 11 songs. Danny has taken a much more laid-back approach rather than having the album be concept-driven. Songs on the album aren't as punchy and hard-hitting like his previous works, either. However, that should not deter you from listening to this album at all. This is still a pretty solid hip-hop album to listen to, with production from some legendary producers like Q-Tip and Flying Lotus, and features from the likes of JPEGMAFIA and Run The Jewels.

        <div class="title">Guns</div>
        <div class="artist">Quelle Chris</div>
    </div>
</a>

Detroit rapper Quelle Chris released his latest solo project this year, Guns. On the album, Chris explores gun usage in black communities and how it affects them. He also examines how skin color is weaponized, and how communities can govern their relationships to firearms. On songs like "Spray and Pray" he depicts how people can get trapped in the cycle of gun use and it is impossible to get out of such a lifestyle. Chris is an incredibly proficient lyricist. So, if you're a fan of lyrical hip-hop, then this album is definitely a must-listen for you. The album takes musical influences from various styles of rap from different areas. These include West Coast rap on songs like "Mind Ya Bidness", early-90's RZA-style production on "It's the Law", "Wild Minks" and more. A very good album and I would definitely recommend this to hip-hop heads.

        <div class="title">All My Heroes Are Cornballs</div>
        <div class="artist">JPEGMAFIA</div>
    </div>
</a>

All My Heroes Are Cornballs, is JPEGMAFIA’s third studio album, following up his critically-acclaimed 2018 sophomore album, Veteran. After the release of the aforementioned Veteran, Peggy recorded around 93 songs for the next project which he whittled to about 18 songs, adding up to the runtime of 45 minutes. There's a lot more singing on this record than his previous record, which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing. But, the quality of singing is really lacking on some of the songs which end up sounding really annoying. Most of the record contains Peggy's signature glitch-hop beats which are very fun to listen to. However, due to their glitchy nature, this record might not really be a listen for hip-hop traditionalists. I, for one, enjoyed this album a lot and even though I don't think that this is the best hip-hop album of the year, it definitely is the best album of the year for me.

        <div class="title">Schlagenheim</div>
        <div class="artist">black midi</div>
    </div>
</a>

Schlagenheim is the debut album by London-based experimental rock band black midi. It's hard to put this album into specific boxes because the album manages to create an amazing mixture of multiple styles of music. Listening to the album, you really can't expect what are you going to experience next in terms of the style. The album doesn't conform to ordinary and traditional song structures. It is jam-packed with different grooves and a lot of tempo changes, constantly throwing you off the hook of what you'll expect the music to be. It is very dense and well-composed. Very much recommend to give this album a listen. Especially if you like genres like math rock and noise rock, you will definitely get a kick out of this album.

        <div class="title">Caligula</div>
        <div class="artist">Lingua Ignota</div>
    </div>
</a>

Caligula is the latest album by Kristin Hayter, also known by her stage name, Lingua Ignota. The album is an unsettling, ominous amalgam of genres and musical styles like noise, industrial, opera and classical music. Listening to this album is an uncommon experience that you will most not likely encounter listening to something else. To call this experience tormenting would be understating it. However, that is not a downside of the album. The album has a very dark, tortured atmosphere; it crawls under your skin. It expresses anguish and agony in full power from the heart of an abuse survivor, tackling the life as an survivor. It is by no means an easy listen, quite the opposite actually. If you can get through the album, it won't disappoint you.

        <div class="title">Infest The Rats' Nest</div>
        <div class="artist">King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard</div>
    </div>
</a>

Infest The Rats' Nest is King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard’s 15th studio album. The album is heavier and more intense than anything else the band has done in the past, with the band citing influences from artists such as Metallica, Slayer, and Rammstein. On Infest the Rat's Nest, the band go full metal. The first half of the album is set in the near future and is about the current situation of humanity, especially ecological disaster. The B-side is a mini-concept album telling the story of a group of rebels who are forced to leave Planet Earth and try to settle on Venus. On the album, the band criticizes human society for the destruction of civilization and the environment. While the album is good enough even just to rock out, it has a very nice concept behind it that will definitely enhance your listen if pay attention.

        <div class="title">H.A.Q.Q.</div>
        <div class="artist">Liturgy</div>
    </div>
</a>

H.A.Q.Q. is the fourth studio album by American black metal band, Liturgy. One way to describe this album easily would be to call it simply, as the band themselves do, "transcendental black metal". The band themselves also describe this album as the "most vulnerable record for Hunter Hunt-Hendrix, addressing anger and struggles around mental health, sexuality, and religion." I don't have much to say about the record other than the fact that I enjoyed it very much. This album might not be for everyone, but do give it a try.

        <div class="title">Bandana</div>
        <div class="artist">Freddie Gibbs & Madlib</div>
    </div>
</a>

Bandana is the second album by the Madgibbs duo, with Freddie handling the rap side and Madlib handling the production like always. Fans are divided between both albums, with some saying that Pinata is better and some saying that the newer one is better. I, personally, prefer this one. Madlib's beats still have the flavour of his signature production - off-kilter, eclectic beats, with skillful use of samples. Freddie's penmanship is still top-notch, with his signature street attitude. The chemistry between these two flourishes very much on this album. This is the best hip-hop album of this year, in my opinion.

        <div class="title">There Existed An Addiction To Blood</div>
        <div class="artist">clipping.</div>
    </div>
</a>

There Existed an Addiction to Blood is the third studio album by American hip hop group clipping. Clipping described There Existed an Addiction to Blood in a press release as a "transmutation of horrorcore," continuing that it "absorbs the hyper-violent horror tropes of the Murder Dog era, but re-imagines them in a new light: still darkly-tinted and somber, but in a weirder and more vivid hue." There Existed an Addiction to Blood absorbs the hyper-violent horror tropes of the Murder Dog era, but re-imagines them in a new light: still darkly-tinted and somber, but in a weirder and more vivid hue. The album is quite gruesome at points. I enjoyed the album a lot and you might, too.

        <div class="title">Hiding Places</div>
        <div class="artist">billy woods & Kenny Segal</div>
    </div>
</div>

Billy Woods and producer Kenny Segal join to bring the first album of woods' since the 2017 release, Known Unknowns. billy woods' style of rapping is pretty unique to him; his tone is kind of monotonous, and his delivery walks a fine line between rap and spoken word poetry. His lyrics have a coat of grittiness and are very cryptic, often layered with a dark sense of humour and heavy cynicism. He doesn't hesitate to commentate cynically on our society, pointing out to us that we live in sick, twisted world. This record is much more close and personal to Billy. On it, he manages to reveal a lot of interesting stories, while somehow still being very private and hidden in the shadows. Give it a listen if heavy-hitting, dark, depressive cynicism doesn't scare you. Amazing album.
