description: A review of Kohinoor, the debut of Indian hip hop artist Divine.
---

DIVINE finally released his debut studio album, Kohinoor. The album consists of just 8 songs with a playtime of around 30–40 minutes. It seems like DIVINE had a very huge budget to work with, considering the production and the features from American rappers Nas and Dave East. However, that doesn’t make it an instant classic. The album is far from it, I feel.

All the songs (except for the interlude) are bangers, of course. However, most of the album feels like it’s just the same message written in different words throughout the album. It is basically DIVINE bragging about his road to success, and DIVINE does an average job at it. The production on the album is pretty average with almost the whole production sounding like a same trap beat with different additions here and there. However, Wallah and Gandhi Money do stand out, in a nice way.

### Kohinoor

The introduction of the album, in the form of the title song Kohinoor, is a very great introduction. In my opinion, it is the best song on the album. The song is full of energy and kicks off the album on a very high note. DIVINE presents us with his classic, energetic flow with a hardcore beat behind, complementing it perfectly. However, I do have some gripes with song. The way DIVINE ends the song by repeating “Hard” for 6 times and saying “Bop, bop, bop” is kind of laughable. The chorus/hook of the song is nothing special, either, and I feel like DIVINE could’ve done really better.

_Rating: 8 / 10_

### Wallah

The second song on the album is another song which is a very listenable, and enjoyable song to an extent. The pre-chorus vocals by Shah Rule are garbage and annoying, almost making me not want to listen to the song. However, Shah Rule’s vocals on the main chorus are pretty good and fun. The beat is a banging beat, pretty hype to listen to. However, as I mentioned before, it sounds almost the same to every other song on the album, just with a little bit of variation.

_Rating: 6 / 10_

### Gandhi Money

The third song, Gandhi Money, is another very enjoyable track on the album. The instrumental is very catchy and fun to listen to. DIVINE finally seems to have switched his flow up a little bit and it is a very welcomed change as it makes the song just a tiny bit more interesting to listen to. My main gripe with this song, again, is the chorus. I don’t have anything against the lyrics of the chorus, but the way DIVINE has sung it is very annoying. I don’t get why he felt it was necessary to sing it himself; he could’ve just used some of the massive budget of the album to feature another artist here and possibly save the song.

_Rating: 6 / 10_

### Nas Interlude

The Nas interlude midway through the album is pointless; it breaks the whole flow of the album up until now and doesn’t add anything to the album either. It is just Nas telling us how he never thought that Hip-Hop would become international and how DIVINE is a very good rapper. I mean, the whole album is just DIVINE telling us how good of a rapper he is, so, this interlude feels absolutely pointless. DIVINE could’ve rather put in a track with sounds of him getting a blowjob with a beat laid on top of it.

_Rating: 0 / 10_

### Vibe Hai

Vibe Hai is the third song of the album with three different rappers being featured on it. However, according to me, it also is the worst song on the album (excluding the interlude, of course) I find the instrumental very annoying. Again, the instrumental doesn’t feel very special and sounds almost the same to the other songs; however, with annoying variation. Even if I was to give the production a pass, the verses from Aavrutti, D’Evil and Shah Rule add nothing to the track and to it’s theme, if it even has one.

_Rating: 4 / 10_

### Chal Bombay

Chal Bombay is another very average track on the album which I didn’t enjoy much. The production on the song is very average, but not totally bad. The chorus sounds something from an EDM song with DIVINE’s vocals being auto-tuned to sound so electronic/robotic. If the song’s idea was executed properly, it could’ve been one of the very better tracks on the album. I can vibe to the underlying theme of the song but DIVINE’s vocals on this track are irritating and his flow is very lackluster. Nothing much to say about this song, other then that it could’ve been the best song but ended up being one of the worst.

_Rating: 4.5 / 10_

### Remand

Remand is the second-last track on the album and it is a very enjoyable track. The instrumental is pretty fine, but also nothing new or groundbreaking. DIVINE comes in with the typical DIVINE flow which is not bad at all and fits the instrumental very well. The line “Mai Sahayadri, tu kankad” is a very fun line which shows that DIVINE is very capable of good wordplay in his lyrics. The Dave East feature on the song is another average verse but enjoyable, nonetheless. However, after the second chorus, I feel like the song should’ve ended there but it continued with an almost “spoken word” verse from DIVINE which was mediocre and didn’t really fit the theme of the song very well.

_Rating: 6.5 / 10_

### Too Hype

The final song Too Hype is another very good track from the album. I felt the song was going to be a little shaky after hearing the R-n-B’ish Jason Derulo-like hook which is sung by Sanjoy, if I remember correctly. However, the beat on the the track is very catchy and amusing with DIVINE’s almost steccato flow feeling like a cherry on the top. DIVINE has some pretty good lyrics on the track as well. It is one of the tracks that I might end up listening to more. I would’ve liked a non-pop chorus on this better, but considering how those have been executed on the album previously, I think this will sit just fine.

_Rating: 6.5 / 10_

### Summary:

I was a little bit disappointed with this record. I feel like the album would’ve been better if it told an actual story rather than the same material being recycled in almost every song. I think DIVINE as a rapper would benefit a lot artistically if he tried harder to create music with a bigger meaning or a concept than just rapping about how he was poor and now has a lot of money and fans. Overall, it is a pretty average album which is nothing new or groundbreaking to Indian Hip-Hop, but still is very much enjoyable other than a couple of tracks. I do feel like I might end up enjoying the album a little bit more on further listening, but as it stands right now, I’m not really feeling this album that much.

**Overall Rating: 6 / 10 (Above Average)**
