description: A review of the album "I Disagree" by Poppy
---

"I Disagree" is the latest album from multi-genre performer Poppy. The album marks a shift in Poppy's sound, moving towards heavy metal in contrast to her previous predominantly pop records. The album is labeled as "post-genre" by Poppy. This album expands the heavy metal sound she dabbled into in some of her previous records.

You might remember Poppy from those weird YouTube videos which can still be found on her YouTube channel. Poppy's music career gained traction when she released her debut studio album, Poppy.Computer. The album solidified the lore around Poppy's character being an android. She rarely sheds that persona. However, leading up to the release of this album, Poppy has been distancing herself from that android persona.

The central messaging of the album is about not adhering to anyone's standards and being able to disagree with people in power. The album empowers you to be non-compliant to the standards of society and to step out of the box. Poppy says that the album is all about "burning the music industry down." This rebellion is amplified because of the heavy metal sound.

## Concrete

The song starts with amazing horns and fast drums. Poppy desires to be buried six feet deep. To bury someone six feet deep means killing them. She wants to kill off her old self, probably the "android" personality. She also talks of burying her and covering her in concrete to turn her into a street. The phrase "turn me into a street" most probably refers to how streets and roads are named after significant people in history, meaning Poppy intends to leave an impression in human history, or at least the musical part of it. After the intro, come some amazing riffs and loud, fast, and heavy drums leading into the bright, playful chorus. Such contrasting themes are found throughout the album where songs transition back and forth. The only verse on the song also sounds shiny but it's far from it. It talks about how commonly joyous items like chocolates don't bring any happiness to her. All she wants is the taste of "young blood" in her teeth.

## I Disagree

"I Disagree" is the title track and the second single from the album. The track starts with some banging drums and the Japanese lines of "Watashi wa anata ni dōi shimasen" which translates roughly to "I disagree with you." I'm in love with the drums on this song. Whilst they're nothing experimental, they're straight bangers. The intro transitions into the first verse with some heavy guitars. The first verse is probably addressing authority figures like the heads of the music industry. The verse is written in anger with Poppy calling out executives. She tells them what they preach is insanity. Their life is a tragedy. The chorus comes in with some heavy guitars and Poppy wanting to "burn it all down." The second verse also talks about her disagreement with the executives on how they continue to pressure artists to act and behave in a certain way. Overall, the sense of rebellion is sharply presented on this track while not lacking in the music.

## BLOODMONEY

Next up is "BLOODMONEY," which might be my favorite song from the album. It is also the most abrasive song on the album with heavy, distorted synths and chunky, overblown drums. The song is about dealing with hypocrisy and liars. The song starts with Poppy being introspective and taking a deeper look into humans' beliefs. The intro questions faith and contradictions that arise from the acts that followers of those faiths commit. By asking what the person believes when nobody is watching, she questions how much does the person believe in the values of the religion they follow and how much is just an act that they put up for other people. She questions whether they follow their religion with the same conviction when they are not in public. The chorus exposes the hypocrisy in the mentality of the people who act righteously in public but are on their knees asking for forgiveness because in their minds they know that they have done a lot of wrong in their own lives. Such people can be found everywhere. Poppy's experience of this might be evident in the music industry where executives constantly abuse their power to milk their artists under the guise of caring for them.

## Anything Like Me

This is the fourth track from the album. It is another one of those songs where it keeps transitioning from being soft and melodious to being very abrasive. The drums on this song are electronic with some warmth. Having done some research, the song seems to be about Poppy's conflicting emotions during the Mars Argo trial. Poppy recently parted ways with Titanic. She recently released a statement detailing this on her Twitter. On the song, Poppy is probably accepting that her online persona was inspired by Argo. She wants to get rid of that. She wants to become authentic and find her own identity instead of mimicking someone else's. This would explain why Poppy has been trying to get rid of the online android persona and adopting new sounds. Musically, it's a pretty good song.

## Fill The Crown

"Fill The Crown" is one of the more synth-pop influenced songs on the album. The chorus is rhythmic and harmonic while the verses go hard with some crazy backing vocals. The chorus inspires the listener to be free, to be anyone they want to be. Goes well with the overall theme of the album, i.e. not conforming to societal norms. The influence of Marilyn Manson on the song is prominent in the verses. Overall, I'm pretty indifferent towards this track. It's nothing special, but it's not bad either.

## Nothing I Need

This track is one of the softest on the record. It's purely a synth-pop track. It reflects on how most of the things that people want, end up being nothing that they need. Poppy contemplates that most of the things she wanted don't matter to her anymore as they aren't something she needs. One of the lines in the first verse probably is referring to Titanic Sinclair. Before the release of the album, Poppy came out with a statement in which she ended her professional relationship with Titanic. In that statement, she talked about how he used to manipulate her. This is probably the power that she talks about in the line.

## Sit / Stay

Higher-ups in the music industry often control artists and curtail their creative freedom. This is the subject at hand that the song tries to tackle. The lyrics of this song are very indicative of this. Executives force artists to stay within lines. They tell them to sit in their place and not get up. They tell them not to talk back because they own them now. The chorus gives the opposite message. It motivates artists not to be controlled and manipulated. Musically, the song is pretty good, too.

## Bite Your Teeth

This is one of the heavier songs on the record. The song is relatively simple in the terms of its lyrics. Alan Watts, a Buddhist philosopher, is quoted here. He said, "Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth." This lyric is repeated throughout the song. The song tells you that even though defining yourself is like an impossible task, you should keep trying to define yourself. Even though the lyrics are simplistic, the song keeps you captivated with an amazing instrumental. The song features a heavy break down towards the end. And that break down is fantastic.

## Sick of the Sun

"Sick of the Sun" is the second-to-last song on the album. The song is encapturing the feelings Poppy felt when she was in a dark, depressive state. The instrumental here isn't as dark as the lyrics are. It's one of the two songs at the end of the record which reference Poppy's depressive state. This song showcases her self-isolation. The chorus captures this feeling of self-isolation perfectly. Poppy speaks of how she is sick of the sun, which in this context, is a metaphor for hope. The fact that she is sick of hope shows despair. She wants this illness to go away. While the lyric of "I just wanna float away" seems gentle, it might be indicating death or suicide in this context. She tells us that she can't trust anyone, which is something that people with depression find difficult to do. In the verse, she asks if someone can turn down the lights. The light here, again, is used as a metaphor for hope. Poppy is depressed and in darkness. Depressed people often get stuck in a rut and find it difficult to get out of it. Poppy is finding it difficult to get out of this endless darkness that she has found herself even when light, as a metaphor for hope, is being shown to her.

## Don't Go Outside

This is the final track on the album. It depicts the next stage during Poppy's depressive state. It portrays the transition from depression to contentment. It starts with a slow, acoustic section. The start of the song continues the theme of self-isolation. It tells that it is not the time to go outside, but rather lock the doors and crawl back into the bed. This refers to the feeling of boxing yourself in. The chorus probably refers to the depressive state of current affairs when talking about how the TV says "we're out of time." Watching the news on the TV makes her even more depressed. This depression paints everything bland and uninteresting, making her not want to go outside. This theme continues until the next time the chorus plays. And then the transition begins. It assures you that everything will be okay as long as you keep trying and don't give up. In the outro, Poppy interpolates lines from three of her songs from the album. This is done to wrap up the album’s central theme. Life may be pointless, but you can still make the most of your time while you’re here. Everything can burn down, but you can still do as you please as it does.

## Overall Album Rating: 8 / 10
