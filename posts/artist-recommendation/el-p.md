If you consider yourself an avid Hip-Hop listener, chances are you already know El-P and his contributions to Hip-Hop. If you don&#39;t, continue reading to learn about El-P himself and why he is an influential figure in the Hip-Hop scene.

_El-Producto_, or El-P as he&#39;s better known, is one of the most forward-thinking artists in Hip-Hop. He started his career in 1992 by forming the group _Company Flow_ along with Mr. Len and Bigg Jus. Company Flow released one of the most critically-acclaimed and loved albums in Hip-Hop, &quot;Funcrusher Plus.&quot; If you&#39;re not familiar with the underground scene in Hip-Hop, chances are you haven&#39;t ever heard about neither this album nor the group. Don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s not your fault. The group released the album mostly independently through Rawkus Records, without much mainstream publicity. Also, the fact that the album is not an easy listen doesn&#39;t help it in terms of popularity. I&#39;ll speak more about the album later.

El-P was heavily involved in the underground Hip-Hop scene in New York. He co-founded one of the most studded underground, alternative record labels, _Definitive Jux_. This record label was home to some essential artists from the New York underground scene, including the likes of Aesop Rock, Cannibal Ox, Murs, and more. The label published some essential Hip-Hop albums like Cannibal Ox&#39;s _The Cold Vein_ and Aesop Rock&#39;s _Labor Days_.

Influence aside, El-P is a top-notch producer and rapper. Production-wise, his style is comparable to EPMD and The Bomb Squad, leaning towards the dense, noisier side of music. One way I&#39;ve seen his production being described is as being &quot;dusty digital.&quot; El&#39;s production is always cutting-edge and innovative. He is no short rapping-wise either. He is one of the most lyrically adept rappers. If you need proof, check out his feature on the track [_Huzzah_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h0K__bYZ64) where he counts from 2 to 13 inside a semi-intricate rhyme pattern.

# Essential Discography:

These are albums from El-P&#39;s discography that are essential to start enjoying El&#39;s music.

## Run The Jewels 2

This is the sophomore album from _Run The Jewels_, El-P&#39;s current duo with Atlanta rapper, Killer Mike. If I were to describe this album in a few words, it would be &quot;unforgivingly raw and in your face.&quot; El-P comes in with amazing production on this one. The album has an almost-perfect mix of semi-political messaging, trash talk and witty dick jokes. Both Mike and El have raw, gritty flows on this record. It is a big &quot;fuck you&quot; to two things RTJ dislike the most - the system and their haters. When I talk about the wonderful mix of topics, I&#39;m talking about the way they make sure that the album is equal parts pure fun and equal parts revolution.

I consider this album the best _RTJ_ album out of the three albums that the duo has currently released.

## Fantastic Damage

Fantastic Damage is El-P&#39;s first solo studio album. It was released through his label, Def Jux, in 2002. The production here is influenced by Public Enemy, like most El-P production. It has a lofi tinge to it and might seem jarring to casual hip-hop listeners who expect groovy and danceable beats. El-P crafts a futuristic, dystopian &quot;soundtrack&quot; for the post-9/11 USA. This is a very dense, industrial record. If the production wasn&#39;t already dense enough, El-P comes in with his signature dejected but confrontational rapping style going through rhyme schemes so complex and amazing, a lot of rappers would sell their soul to the devil if they could do achieve even half of what El-P achieves on this record.

## Funcrusher Plus

Funcrusher Plus is the debut studio album by Company Flow which consisted of El-P, Bigg Jus, and Mr. Len. The record is often considered a &quot;landmark&quot; independent hip-hop release. This record has an important place in the landscape of abstract hip-hop. It was one of the definitive records that would heavily influence abstract, sci-fi hip-hop in the coming times. El-P&#39;s production is abrasive and gritty as always which might make this release a hard listen for some people. However, if you&#39;ve listened to other El-P releases and loved them, then you&#39;re most probably going to love this as well. The production on this is very tight and tense, combined with all the rappers&#39; complex rhyme schemes.

## The Cold Vein

_Cannibal Ox_&#39;s The Cold Vein is one of the best underground hip-hop albums to ever be. The reason it is featured here is that the whole album was produced by El-P and he also has some features on it. It was released on El-P&#39;s record label at the time, _Def Jux_. The album creates a vivid depiction of a poverty-stricken New York, whilst referencing a lot of science fiction. The sci-fi aesthetic does not stop in the lyrics, it can also be found in the production. El-P&#39;s production here is grandiose yet gritty. It moves past the basic boom-bap sounds of the era, and ups it a notch. The sounds here are sci-fi to the core, gleaming but maintaining the grimy nature of the record. The album was a great influence on other rappers of the abstract style.
